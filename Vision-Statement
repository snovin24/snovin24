Part 1
Who you're working with, or hope to work with
I am largely working with second-year students of the Translational Research Program from the University of Toronto.

What you're doing
Offering a program-wide training seminar for second-year Translational Research Program students. The seminar will develop their ability to use select digital research infrastructure tools (DRI) and encourage them to apply these platforms to their Capstone Projects.

Who you're doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)
See above

Why you're doing this, the impact of change you hope to make
Translational Research requires continuous engagement with stakeholders. Stakeholders often do not have sufficient scientific knowledge to understand TR concepts. Visualization of these abstract concepts can facilitate stakeholder partnerships, improving engagement strategies and streamlining the engagement process.

Part 2
I am working with second-year Translational Research Program students from the Uniersity of Toronto to offer a program-wide training seminar for digital research infrastructure platforms so that second-year Translational Research Program students can better engage with layperson stakeholders in their research endeavours.
